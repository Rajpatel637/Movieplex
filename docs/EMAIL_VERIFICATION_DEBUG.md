firebase.auth().currentUser?.sendEmailVerification()
```

### 6. **Email Provider Specific Tips**

#### Gmail
- Check "All Mail" folder
- Look in "Promotions" tab
- Search for "movieplex" or "verification"

#### Outlook/Hotmail
- Check "Junk Email" folder
- Check "Focused" vs "Other" inbox tabs
- Look in "Deleted Items" (sometimes auto-filtered)

#### Yahoo
- Check "Spam" folder
- Look in "Bulk" folder
- Check email filters/rules

### 7. **Alternative Verification Method**

If email verification continues to fail, you can:
1. Skip email verification for development
2. Use a different email address
3. Check Firebase Console to manually verify users
4. Implement phone verification as backup

### 8. **Debug Information**

When registering, check browser console for these logs:
```
üîµ Starting user registration for: your-email@example.com
‚úÖ User created successfully: [user-id]
üîÑ Updating user profile...
‚úÖ User profile updated
üìß Sending email verification to: your-email@example.com
‚úÖ Email verification sent successfully
```

If you see "‚ùå Failed to send email verification", there's an issue with the email sending process.
