# Firebase Email Deliverability Setup Guide

## Why Emails Go to Spam

Firebase emails from new projects often go to spam because:
1. **New domain reputation** - Firebase domains need to build trust
2. **Generic templates** - Default email templates trigger spam filters
3. **Missing SPF/DKIM** - Email authentication not configured
4. **High volume sending** - Firebase sends many emails daily

## Immediate Solutions

### 1. **User Instructions (Implemented)**
âœ… Added detailed instructions in the app for users to:
- Check spam folder first
- Mark as "Not Spam" 
- Add sender to contacts
- Move to primary inbox

### 2. **Firebase Console Email Template Customization**

#### Go to Firebase Console:
1. Visit: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/movieplex-b29e4
2. Navigate to **Authentication > Templates**
3. Click **Email address verification**

#### Customize the Email Template:
```
Subject: Welcome to MoviePlex - Verify Your Email

Body:

SPF Record: v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all

DMARC: v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc@yourdomain.com
```
