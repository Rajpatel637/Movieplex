# Google Authentication Debug Guide

## Current Issue
Google Sign-in is showing both success and error messages simultaneously.

## Debug Steps Completed âœ…

### 1. Enhanced Google Auth Provider Configuration
- âœ… Added proper scopes: `profile`, `email`
- âœ… Added custom parameter: `prompt: select_account`
- âœ… Enhanced error handling with specific Google error codes

### 2. Improved Error Handling
- âœ… Added detailed console logging for debugging
- âœ… Prevent duplicate Google login calls
- âœ… Specific error messages for Google auth issues

## Firebase Console Verification Checklist

Please check your Firebase project console at: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/movieplex-b29e4

### Authentication Settings
1. **Authentication > Sign-in method > Google**
   - [ ] Google sign-in is ENABLED
   - [ ] Web SDK configuration is properly set up
   - [ ] Support email is configured

2. **Authentication > Settings > Authorized domains**
   - [ ] `localhost` is in the list
   - [ ] If you're hosting elsewhere, add your domain
   - [ ] Remove any unnecessary domains

3. **Authentication > Users**
   - Check if users are being created even when error shows

### Project Settings
4. **Project settings > General**
   - [ ] Web apps section shows your app
   - [ ] Firebase SDK snippet matches your config

5. **Project settings > Service accounts**
   - [ ] Google Auth provider is properly configured

## Debug Information to Check

### 1. Browser Console Logs
With the enhanced logging, check for these logs when attempting Google sign-in:
```
ðŸ”µ Starting Google sign-in...
ðŸŸ¢ Google sign-in success: [user info]
ðŸ”´ Google sign-in error: [error details]
```

### 2. Network Tab
- Check for any 400/401/403 errors during the OAuth flow
- Look for blocked requests to Google OAuth endpoints

### 3. Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue: "unauthorized-domain"
**Solution**: Add your domain to authorized domains in Firebase Console

#### Issue: "popup-blocked"
**Solution**: User needs to allow popups for your site

#### Issue: "popup-closed-by-user"
**Solution**: User closed the popup - not an error, handle gracefully

#### Issue: Mixed success/error messages
**Possible Causes**:
- Race condition between success and error handlers
- Multiple event listeners attached
- User state not properly cleared before new attempt

## Testing Steps

1. **Clear Browser Data**
   ```
   Clear cookies, localStorage, and session storage for localhost
   ```

2. **Test Different Scenarios**
   - [ ] Fresh browser session
   - [ ] Incognito mode
   - [ ] Different Google account
   - [ ] Already signed in to Google vs not signed in

3. **Check User Creation**
   - Even if error shows, check if user is created in Firebase Console
   - Check if user data is saved to Firestore

## Next Debugging Steps

If the issue persists:

1. **Add More Logging**
   - Log the complete error object
   - Log the user state before/after sign-in attempt

2. **Check Firebase Console Users**
   - See if users are being created despite the error message

3. **Test Auth State Persistence**
   - Refresh the page after "error" to see if user is actually signed in

## Quick Test

Run this in your browser console after a "failed" Google sign-in:
```javascript
// Check if user is actually signed in
firebase.auth().currentUser && console.log('User is signed in:', firebase.auth().currentUser.email);
```

## Contact Support

If none of these steps resolve the issue, the problem might be:
- Firebase project configuration
- Google Cloud Console OAuth settings
- Regional restrictions
